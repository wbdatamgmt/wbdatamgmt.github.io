In this course, the participants will learn advanced Excel functions that will help them manage and analyse data more efficiently. They will learn about VLOOKUP, IF statements, and PivotTables, enabling them to match data from one worksheet to another, analyse data based on conditions, and summarize and analyse large amounts of data.

## Components
1.	Data Validation: This video will cover how to use data validation to control the type of data that can be entered into a cell. Participants will learn how to create drop-down lists, restrict data entry to specific ranges, and create custom error messages.
2.	Conditional Formatting: In this video, participants will learn how to use conditional formatting to highlight important data in their spreadsheets. They will learn how to apply colour scales and data bars to visualize their data.
3.	IF Statements: In this video, the participants will learn how to use IF statements to analyse data and create conditions that will determine the outcome of a cell.
4.	COUNTIF/COUNTIFS and SUMIF/SUMIFS: This video will show how to use functions for counting or summing data based on a specific criteria.
5.	PivotTables: This video will cover how to use PivotTables to analyse and summarize large amounts of data. Participants will learn how to create a PivotTable, modify the layout and format, and apply filters to the data.
6.	VLOOKUP: This video will teach the participants how to use VLOOKUP function in Excel to find data from one table and insert it into another table based on a matching value.
7.	INDEX and MATCH: In this video, participants will learn how to use the INDEX and MATCH functions to look up data in a table. This can be a more flexible alternative to using VLOOKUP, as it allows for data to be looked up based on multiple criteria.
